\section*{Appendix: Prompt Optimization for Comic Generation}
\subsection*{Scene Design Trade-offs: Detail vs. Output Quality}

To investigate how scene description complexity impacts the quality of AI-generated comic visuals, we constructed two versions of Scene 3 (corresponding to Section 3 of the paper). The first version aimed for maximum fidelity and completeness; the second version prioritized clarity and simplicity for more robust visual synthesis. Results suggest that over-detailed prompts can reduce image quality or lead to cluttered, incoherent visuals.

\textbf{Title: The Solution – “Gaze-Centric Loss”}

\textbf{Panel 1: "The Problem with Standard Training"} \\
Characters: Scientist A and B in lab, screen shows odd eye behavior in face swap. \\
Dialogue: “These models treat every pixel the same—even the eyes!” / “No wonder the gaze always feels... wrong.” \\
Visuals: Full neural network diagram with encoder/decoder structure, facial heatmaps, warning signs on eyes.

\textbf{Panel 2: "A New Kind of Loss"} \\
Characters: Scientist A coding, screen shows math and diagrams. \\
Dialogue: “Let’s align the predicted gaze vector with the real one... using L2CS-Net...” \\
Visuals: Code snippets, annotated formulas, training hyperparameters written on sticky notes.

\textbf{Panel 3: "Training with Gaze Focus"} \\
Characters: Scientists watching training dashboard. \\
Dialogue: “Now it compares gaze angles and fixes them during training.” \\
Visuals: Animated training loop with gaze heatmaps, 3D face mesh, dynamic arrows showing gaze correction.

\textbf{Panel 4: "A Clearer Vision"} \\
Characters: Scientist B comparing two images. \\
Dialogue: “Now it actually follows your eyes.” \\
Visuals: Side-by-side face comparison, technical overlays showing angle deltas, labeled graphs.

\textbf{Title: The Fix – “Training the Eyes”}

\textbf{Panel 1: “Standard Training = Bad Gaze”} \\
Characters: Scientist A, frustrated at his screen. \\
Dialogue: “Why do the eyes always feel so… fake?” \\
Visuals: Side-by-side swapped faces, one with strange gaze.

\textbf{Panel 2: “Idea Spark”} \\
Characters: Scientist B holding a sketch of gaze arrows. \\
Dialogue: “Let’s teach the model to match the real gaze!” \\
Visuals: Simple diagram with before/after gaze alignment.

\textbf{Panel 3: “Gaze Loss in Action”} \\
Characters: Both scientists watching a training animation. \\
Dialogue: “Now it compares gaze angles and fixes them during training.” \\
Visuals: Progress bar labeled “Learning Gaze”, arrows adjusting gaze in face.

\textbf{Panel 4: “The Results Look Better”} \\
Characters: Scientist B holding two printouts. \\
Dialogue: “Now this one feels human.” \\
Visuals: Comparison of face with misaligned vs natural gaze, labeled “Before / After”.
