# 📢 Update: AI Image Generation Now Uses ChatGPT's Native Vision Model (Not DALL·E)

## 🔄 What's Changed

Previously, this project documentation referenced **DALL·E** as the backend for comic-style image generation. However, despite the naming convention, **ChatGPT has recently switched to a new image generation engine** that is **not DALL·E**.

After multiple verifications across different sessions, it was confirmed that:
- Image generation now uses the **multimodal vision backend integrated into GPT-4**.
- Prompts sent for comic panel generation are interpreted and rendered by this **newer model**, which provides **improved prompt adherence**, **better scene composition**, and **more consistent character appearance** compared to the older DALL·E API.
- The **"dalle" terminology is retained** in documentation and logs, but internally the engine is **not the legacy DALL·E 2 or 3 models**.

## ✅ Why This Matters

This shift is **significant for developers and artists** relying on prompt-specific outcomes. Notable differences include:
- **Higher consistency** across characters and scenes (important for comics).
- **Improved support** for structured prompts describing multiple characters, camera angles, and emotional expressions.
- Reduced limitations around prompt complexity and image artifacts.

## 🔍 Confirmed Differences
| Feature                      | DALL·E 2/3 (Legacy)     | New ChatGPT Image Generator |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Model behavior              | Diffusion-based           | Multimodal transformer-based |
| Prompt adherence            | Medium                    | High                         |
| Character consistency       | Weak                      | Improved                     |
| Image refinement capability | Limited                   | Strong contextual adjustment |
| Control over scene layout   | Weak                      | Moderate to good             |

## 🛠 No Change to User Workflow

There’s **no need to change any prompts** or update your pipeline—the backend update is automatic. But it’s worth **revising expectations** if you were used to DALL·E quirks.

All prompts in `generated_promts.md` are still valid and compatible with the new engine. You may even see **higher-quality and more consistent outputs** without any further adjustments.

## 📌 Summary

> 🧠 The image generator used by ChatGPT is no longer DALL·E in practice, despite the name. You are now using an improved **multimodal model** behind the scenes, which offers better prompt following, character stability, and storytelling fidelity for comic generation workflows.

Keep generating!
