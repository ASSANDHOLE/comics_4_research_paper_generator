# **Automated Research Paper Comic Generation: Technical Overview**

## **1. Objective**
The goal was to **convert a research paper into a visually engaging comic** that is **easy to understand** for non-experts. The comic needed to be:
- **Automated**, requiring minimal manual intervention.
- **Visually consistent**, ensuring character identity across different panels.
- **Narratively structured**, with text and images aligned to tell a coherent story.

---

## **2. Key Challenges & Considerations**
- **Maintaining Character Consistency:** AI-generated characters often vary between different prompts.
- **Automating Scene Breakdown:** Mapping research concepts into **sequential, easy-to-follow panels**.
- **Generating Both Text & Images:** The **dialogue (what the character says)** and **scene descriptions (context for placement)** must be well-defined for AI generation.
- **Minimizing Manual Work:** Avoid manual image editing or positioning in a document.

---

## **3. The Approach**
The **pipeline** was designed to **automate comic generation** using **generative AI models** and **structured metadata**.

### **Step 1: Research Paper Understanding & Scene Breakdown**
- The research paper was analyzed and broken down into **key concepts** suitable for **comic storytelling**.
- Each scene was structured into **4 panels**, covering:
  - **What happens in each panel (scene description).**
  - **What the character says or the narration text.**
- This structured breakdown ensured that both the **visuals** and **dialogue** aligned logically.

### **Step 2: Character Generation & Consistency Handling**
- Instead of **describing characters manually in prompts**, we experimented with using **names as latent anchors** (e.g., "Zhaolong Tong" as a prompt).
- This improved **visual consistency** between different AI-generated images of the same character.
- (*Not implemented*) ~~Additional refinements were explored using **DreamBooth fine-tuning** for greater character fidelity.~~

### **Step 3: Image Generation Using AI**
- **DALL·E was used** to generate comic-style images based on structured prompts.
- We iterated on:
  - **Character expressions & actions** (e.g., "Mark Chen looking confused at his phone").
  - **Scene compositions** (e.g., "Dr. Wu presenting in a conference room").
  - **AI explanations within the images** (e.g., annotated side-by-side face swap results).
- Images were structured into **sequential IDs** (`0.png`, `1.png`, etc.) for automated pairing.

### **Step 4: Text & Image Integration**
- The structured scene breakdown (from Step 1) was converted into **dialogues.json**, a metadata file containing:
  - **Image ID** → **Mapped to the filename**.
  - **Dialogue Text** → **What the character says or narration.**
  - **Image Description** → **Context for placement.**
- This allowed the **text to be automatically overlaid** on AI-generated images.

## **4. Comic Display & Automation**
- The **images and dialogues were dynamically displayed** using a simple **HTML+JS interface**.
- The system:
  - Read `images.json` (image filenames).
  - Read `dialogues.json` (text mappings).
  - Rendered the comic **in a structured, numbered format**.
  - Adjusted dialogue box size dynamically to **fit within images**.
- This approach minimized **manual formatting** (e.g., placing images in a document or LaTeX).

---

## **5. Future Enhancements**
- **Fine-Tuning AI Models for Character Consistency:** Implement **DreamBooth or ControlNet** for **tighter character control**.
- **Better Scene Composition Handling:** Instead of **separate AI generations**, use **multi-panel layouts** generated by AI.
- **Speech Bubble Automation:** Replace **text overlays** with **AI-generated speech bubbles** inside images.
- **Automated Research Paper Summarization:** Convert **raw research papers into structured scene scripts** automatically.

---

## **Conclusion**
This pipeline successfully **automated research paper visualization as a comic** by combining **AI-generated imagery, structured metadata, and dynamic rendering**. The approach ensures **consistent character visuals, structured storytelling, and minimal manual input**, making it **scalable for future research communications**.
